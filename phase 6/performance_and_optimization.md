# Phase 6: Expert Level ‚Äî Part 2  
### ‚ö° Performance and Optimization

As your JavaScript applications grow, so does the need for performance.  
This phase helps you understand how browsers execute your code and how to optimize it for speed, memory efficiency, and responsiveness.

## üß† 1. Understanding Performance

Every JavaScript application competes for **CPU, memory, and network** resources.  
Knowing how your code runs helps you make it faster.

### Key Concepts
- **Execution Context & Call Stack:** Know how functions are called and stacked.
- **Event Loop:** Understand how JavaScript handles asynchronous tasks.
- **Memory Usage:** Avoid leaks and unnecessary allocations.
- **Reflows & Repaints:** DOM changes can slow rendering‚Äîminimize them.

‚úÖ **Goal:** Learn to spot and eliminate performance bottlenecks early.

## ‚è±Ô∏è 2. Debouncing and Throttling

These two patterns control **how often functions run** during repetitive events like scrolling or resizing.

- **Debouncing:** Delays a function until a certain amount of time passes after the last event.  
  *Best for:* search inputs, window resizing.

- **Throttling:** Ensures a function runs at most once in a set time interval.  
  *Best for:* scroll events, mouse movements.

‚úÖ **Goal:** Improve app responsiveness by reducing unnecessary re-renders and function calls.

## üß© 3. Lazy Loading

**Lazy loading** delays loading of non-critical resources (like images or data) until they‚Äôre needed.  
This reduces initial load time and improves user experience.

### Applications
- Images load as the user scrolls down.  
- Components render only when visible.  
- Data fetched on demand rather than all at once.

‚úÖ **Goal:** Build apps that start fast and load progressively.

---

## üßπ 4. Memory Management

JavaScript uses **garbage collection** to free up unused memory, but bad code can still cause leaks.

### Common Causes
- Unremoved event listeners.  
- Retained references to DOM elements.  
- Global variables or large arrays never cleared.

### Best Practices
- Remove listeners when not needed.  
- Use local variables instead of globals.  
- Clear timeouts, intervals, and caches properly.

‚úÖ **Goal:** Keep your app lightweight and stable during long use.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 5. Code Splitting and Minification

Splitting and compressing your JavaScript ensures faster page loads.

### Code Splitting
Break your code into smaller bundles loaded only when needed.

### Minification
Remove unnecessary spaces, comments, and shorten variable names using tools like:
- **Terser**
- **UglifyJS**
- **Webpack**

‚úÖ **Goal:** Ship minimal, optimized code to users.

## üß≠ 6. Web Workers

**Web Workers** let you run heavy tasks on a **separate thread**, so the UI stays responsive.

### Use Cases
- Processing large data sets.  
- Image or video manipulation.  
- Background computations.

‚úÖ **Goal:** Offload expensive operations from the main thread to prevent freezes or lag.
